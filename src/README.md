# Project Workspaces

This repository contains multiple workspaces for organizing and managing different aspects of our project. Each workspace serves a specific purpose and contains related code and resources. Below, we introduce each workspace and explain its role in the project.

1. Components

The components workspace is dedicated to housing reusable and self-contained UI components. These components are designed to be easily integrated into various parts of the application. Keeping them separate from other code allows for better code organization and promotes code reusability across different projects.

2. Elements

The elements workspace focuses on defining and maintaining custom HTML elements. These elements encapsulate specific functionality and can be used throughout the project. By separating elements from other code, we ensure a clean and modular codebase, making it simpler to add new features and maintain existing ones.

3. Directive

In the directive workspace, we manage custom directives. These directives enable us to extend HTML elements with new behaviors or apply special functionality to specific parts of the application. Keeping directives isolated allows us to manage them effectively and apply them only where needed.

4. Pixel

The pixel workspace contains style-related resources and configuration files. It encompasses style resets, reusable CSS tokens (such as colors, fonts, and spacing), and other style-related utilities. Separating the style-related code from other project components allows us to maintain a consistent and cohesive visual design across the application.

5. Polyfill

The polyfill workspace handles the inclusion and management of polyfills. Polyfills are essential for adding support for modern JavaScript features to older browsers that lack native support. This workspace ensures that our application runs smoothly on a wide range of browsers, providing a seamless experience for all users.

6. Standard

The standard workspace is responsible for defining and enforcing code standards and best practices across the entire project. It may contain configuration files, linters, and other tools that help maintain code quality and consistency. By centralizing the standards, we can ensure that all developers follow the same guidelines and produce high-quality, maintainable code.
