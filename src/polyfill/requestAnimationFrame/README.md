# Polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame`

The following code is a polyfill for the `requestAnimationFrame` function, which is used to schedule animations and other tasks that require smooth rendering. This polyfill provides a fallback implementation for environments that do not support `requestAnimationFrame`.

```js
/**
 * Polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame` function.
 * If `requestAnimationFrame` is not supported in the current environment,
 * this polyfill will use `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 as a fallback.
 *
 * @param {function} functionRef - The callback function to be executed.
 */
!('requestAnimationFrame' in window) && (
  Reflect.defineProperty(window, 'requestAnimationFrame', {
    value (functionRef) {
      setTimeout(functionRef, 0)
    }
  })
)
```

### Parameters

- `functionRef` (function): The callback function to be executed when the animation frame is ready.

### Behavior

The `requestAnimationFrame` function is a method provided by modern browsers to schedule a function to be executed before the next repaint, typically at the screen refresh rate. It allows developers to perform smooth animations and efficiently utilize system resources for rendering.

However, in older browsers or environments that do not support `requestAnimationFrame`, the polyfill will define a new `requestAnimationFrame` function on the `window` object. This polyfill will use `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 milliseconds as a fallback to mimic the behavior of `requestAnimationFrame`.

### Example Usage

```js
// Define an animation function
function animate(timestamp) {
  // Your animation logic here...
  console.log('Animating at', timestamp)
  // Request the next animation frame
  window.requestAnimationFrame(animate)
}

// Start the animation
window.requestAnimationFrame(animate)
```

In this example, the `animate` function is scheduled to be executed before the next repaint using the `window.requestAnimationFrame` method. If the browser supports `requestAnimationFrame`, it will provide the actual timestamp for each frame. If not, the polyfill will use `setTimeout` to schedule the `animate` function with a delay of 0 milliseconds, effectively executing the animation function as soon as possible.
